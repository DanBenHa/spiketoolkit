def getISIRatio(unit_spike_train, sampling_frequency):
    '''This function calculates the ratio between the frequency of spikes present
    within 0- to 2-ms (refractory period) interspike interval (ISI) and those at 0- to 20-ms
    interval. Taken from:

     "Large-scale, high-density (up to 512 channels) recording of local circuits
     in behaving animals" - Antal Ber√©nyi, et al.

    Parameters
    ----------
    unit_spike_train: array_like
        1D array of spike times in frames (sorted in ascending chronological order)
    sampling_frequency: float
        The sampling frequency of recording

    Returns
    ----------
    ISI_ratio: float
        The ratio between the frequency of spikes present within 0- to 2-ms ISI
        and those at 0- to 20-ms interval.
